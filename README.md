## Hi, I'm Rafia 👾

I'm a [programmer](https://www.rafiamobashira.com/) from Philadelphia!  

Currently, I'm a third-year Computer Science & Economics student at Yale building predictive models and data-driven systems that explore how intelligent algorithms influence behavior. I primarily work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL, and I’m constantly expanding my technical toolkit.

I’m particularly drawn to recommendation systems, applied ML, and high-impact products that operate at scale. I’m fascinated by the full product lifecycle, from data exploration and model development to deployment, iteration, and measuring user impact.

Outside of technical work, I’m interested in digital media and product design. I enjoy coding and designing useful everyday tools, mastering video and photo editing tools, and have created lifestyle content that has generated 250k+ interactions through experimentation in marketing and algorithmic insights.
