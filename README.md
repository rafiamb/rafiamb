## Hi, I'm Rafia 👾

I'm a programmer from Philadelphia!  

Currently, I'm a third-year Computer Science & Economics student at Yale.  
I primarily work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL, but I love learning new tools, too.  

I enjoy experimenting with AI applications and analyzing their impacts.  
On a day-to-day basis, I enjoy using code to make life more fun and efficient (mostly fun).  
But that's not all. I also spend my time video/photo editing, creating content for social media, and trying new foods — big foodie here!
