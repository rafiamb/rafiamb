## Hi, I'm Rafia 👾

I'm a [programmer](https://www.rafiamobashira.com/) from Philadelphia!  

I'm a third-year CS & Econ student at Yale building predictive models and data-driven systems that explore how intelligent algorithms influence behavior. I primarily work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL, and I’m always expanding my toolkit.

I’m drawn to recommendation systems, applied ML, and high-impact products that operate at scale. I’m fascinated by the full product lifecycle, from data exploration to deployment and measuring user impact.

Outside of school, I tinker in digital media and graphic design, coding everyday tools, mastering video/photo editing, and creating lifestyle content that has generated 250k+ interactions through marketing experimentation.
